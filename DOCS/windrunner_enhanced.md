## Chapter 1: The Nameless Mare

The wind carved its ancient song through the frozen wastes of Uckland, a howling symphony that had echoed unchanged since the world was young. Here, where the earth stretched endlessly white beneath a dome of brittle sky, my father's lessons echoed sharper than any blade could ever hope to be. His voice would cut through the perpetual keen of arctic air, each word crystallizing in the space between us like visible truth. "The world shows no mercy to the unprepared," he would say, his calloused hands—scarred by countless encounters with frostbite and the razor edges of survival—steady as granite as he taught me that civilization was nothing more than a beautiful lie we told ourselves to sleep through the endless winter nights that stretched like eternity across these forgotten lands.

Those hands had buried my mother when I was seven, carved her name into a marker stone that the wind would slowly erase. Those same hands had taught me to read the subtle signatures of weather in cloud formations, to distinguish between the seventeen different types of snow that could mean the difference between shelter and death, to understand that every sunrise was a negotiation with forces that cared nothing for human want or need. The scars that mapped his knuckles told stories of ice-burned rope, of metal so cold it seared like fire, of the thousand small violences that survival demanded in this place where winter was not a season but a way of being.

I was seventeen when she came—seventeen and already ancient in the particular wisdom that only the ice-born carry in their bones.

The frost had claimed three horses that season, their final breaths crystallizing in small, perfect clouds beneath an indifferent sky that watched their passing with the same cold attention it paid to everything else. Jarak, the old stallion whose steady presence had anchored our small herd for eight hard winters, his great heart finally surrendering to the relentless cold that had stalked him for months. Moonfall, the young mare whose foal had never lived to see spring, her eyes growing dim with the particular grief that horses carry differently than humans but no less deeply. And Steadfast, whose very name had become a mockery when his heart simply stopped beating one morning, as if he had finally grown too weary of the relentless struggle against the cold.

We who were born to these wastes know the weight of such losses—each death a reminder carved in ice and sorrow that all attachment is borrowed time, loaned to us by forces that demand payment with compound interest. The frozen ground yields reluctantly to shovels, each grave a battle won against earth that would rather remain untouched until the thaw that might never come. My father had taught me well: the frost-born give no names to what they know they must release. To name something is to claim it. To claim it is to love it. To love it is to lose it. Better to cherish without grasping, to hold without binding.

But when I saw her cresting the ridge that morning, silhouetted against a sky the color of old steel and ancient promises, I understood with devastating clarity why some truths resist even the wisest teachings.

The sun hung low and pale, a disk of beaten silver that offered light without warmth, casting long shadows that stretched like dark fingers across the snow-covered earth. The air carried that particular crystalline quality that comes just before a storm, when every sound becomes sharp-edged and significant, when the very atmosphere seems to hold its breath in anticipation. I had been checking the wind-breaks we'd built around the remaining horses, ensuring they would hold against whatever weather was coming, when movement on the northern ridge caught my eye.

At first, she was nothing more than a distant speck against the white expanse, a dark note in a symphony of emptiness. But as she drew closer, flowing down the slope like liquid mercury, she became unmistakably herself—a presence so vital and alive that she seemed to reshape the very landscape around her simply by existing within it.

She was wild in the way that only truly untamed things can be—not the desperate, cornered wildness of the broken, not the frantic energy of something trying to escape captivity, but the complete, absolute wildness of something that had never known restraint, had never felt the weight of bit or bridle or human expectation. Her coat was the deep gray of storm clouds pregnant with lightning, each hair seeming to catch and hold the pale light of the winter sun. When she moved, it was as if the very wind had taken flesh and bone and decided to run across the earth for the sheer joy of motion.

The way she ran... gods above and below, the way she ran. Like she was racing the horizon itself, like she could outpace the turning of seasons if only she tried hard enough, like motion was prayer and speed was salvation. Her hooves threw up small explosions of snow with each stride, creating a wake of white powder that hung in the air behind her like the ghost of her passage. There was no fear in her movement, no hesitation—only pure, undiluted purpose. She ran as if running were the only thing in the world that mattered, as if she were chasing something just beyond the curve of the earth, something that would always remain tantalizingly out of reach.

The other men called her Windrunner, though I never spoke the name aloud. Names are chains we forge in hope, links of expectation and desire that bind both the namer and the named to patterns of meaning that may or may not reflect truth. I had been taught that hope, like warmth, was a luxury the frozen wastes could not afford—a dangerous indulgence that led to the kind of suffering that broke stronger men than I would ever be. Yet watching her dance across the snow-covered steppes, her movement a living poem written in tracks that the wind would soon erase, I felt something stir in my chest—something dangerous and warm and utterly defiant of my father's careful lessons about the futility of attachment.

She never came close enough to touch, never slowed her eternal race against the dying light. The nearest she ever approached was perhaps two hundred yards, close enough that I could see the intelligent gleam in her dark eyes, the way her breath created small clouds that dissipated quickly in the dry air. Close enough to see that she was aware of me watching, that my presence was noted and acknowledged but not feared. In those moments, suspended between distance and desire, I felt as though we were engaged in some ancient conversation that required no words, only the patient grammar of witness and wonder.

Every morning, as the sun bled pale gold across the wasteland like honey poured over ice, she would appear on the horizon—first as a distant speck that might have been anything, a trick of light or shadow or wishful thinking, then growing larger and more defined until she became unmistakably herself. And every evening, as darkness crept across the frozen earth like a hungry wolf padding silently through the twilight, she would disappear into the gathering shadows, becoming one with the darkness that swallowed the world each night.

I began to structure my days around these appearances, though I told myself it was coincidence, practical efficiency. I would find myself working near the northern fence line in the mornings, checking snares and wind-breaks that didn't really need checking. In the evenings, I would volunteer for the final rounds, ensuring the remaining horses were secure for the night, all while keeping one eye on the horizon where she would eventually emerge from or dissolve into the vast emptiness that surrounded our small island of human persistence.

My father noticed, of course. He noticed everything—it was part of what had kept us alive in a place where inattention was often fatal. "That mare will break your heart," he said one evening as we sat beside the small fire that was our only concession to comfort, the flames casting dancing shadows on the rough walls of our shelter. "Wild things cannot be tamed, and tame things cannot survive out there. She belongs to the wind and the cold and the endless spaces. You belong here, with responsibilities and survival and the weight of practical choices. Don't confuse admiration with ownership, boy. That way lies madness."

His words carried the weight of experience, the accumulated wisdom of a man who had learned to measure love by its capacity for loss. But I knew, even then, that she was teaching me something my father's harsh wisdom had not prepared me for. That sometimes, the very act of witnessing beauty—knowing it must pass, knowing it cannot last, knowing that the wild thing will always choose freedom over safety—is precisely what makes us human. That the temporary nature of beauty does not diminish it but rather makes each moment of witnessing a kind of miracle, a gift that asks for nothing in return except the willingness to see.

The frost-born give no names to what they know they must release.

But they remember. Gods help them, they remember everything. Every stride, every toss of a wild mane, every moment when something beautiful chose to exist in their field of vision. They remember because memory is all that remains when the wind finally carries the wild things away, when winter claims what it will and leaves only the stories we tell ourselves to ward off the cold.

And in the remembering, perhaps, we find something that even the harshest wisdom cannot take away—the knowledge that we have been witnesses to wonder, that we have seen the wind take flesh and run free across the world.
