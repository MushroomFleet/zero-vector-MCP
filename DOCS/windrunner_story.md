## Chapter 1: The Nameless Mare

The wind carved its ancient song through the frozen wastes of Uckland, where my father's lessons echoed sharper than any blade. "The world shows no mercy to the unprepared," he would say, his calloused hands steady as he taught me that civilization was nothing more than a beautiful lie we told ourselves to sleep through winter nights.

I was seventeen when she came.

The frost had claimed three horses that season, their breath crystallizing in final gasps beneath an indifferent sky. We who were born to these wastes know the weight of such losses—each death a reminder that all attachment is borrowed time. My father had taught me well: the frost-born give no names to what they know they must release.

But when I saw her cresting the ridge that morning, silhouetted against a sky the color of old steel, I understood why some truths resist even the wisest teachings.

She was wild in the way that only untamed things can be—not the desperate wildness of the broken, but the complete wildness of something that had never known captivity. Her coat was the deep gray of storm clouds, and when she moved, it was as if the very wind had taken flesh. The way she ran... gods, the way she ran. Like she was racing the horizon itself, like she could outpace the turning of seasons if only she tried hard enough.

The other men called her Windrunner, though I never spoke the name aloud. Names are chains we forge in hope, and I had been taught that hope, like warmth, was a luxury the frozen wastes could not afford. Yet watching her dance across the snow-covered steppes, I felt something stir in my chest—something that defied my father's careful lessons about the futility of attachment.

She never came close enough to touch, never slowed her eternal race against the dying light. But every morning, as the sun bled pale gold across the wasteland, she would appear on the horizon. And every evening, as darkness crept across the frozen earth like a hungry wolf, she would disappear into the gathering shadows.

I knew, even then, that she was teaching me something my father's harsh wisdom had not prepared me for. That sometimes, the very act of witnessing beauty—knowing it must pass, knowing it cannot last—is precisely what makes us human.

The frost-born give no names to what they know they must release.

But they remember. Gods help them, they remember everything.
